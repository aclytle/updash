Updash is a bash script I wrote to automatically backup my helmet cam footage
from the camera or memory card onto an external hard drive or nfs share. It's
running on a raspberry pi which I plug the camera into every night. I've only tested
this on Debian stretch and Raspbian, but it should work on any modern linux distro.

Requires: udev, udevil, systemd

Edit the setting in the updash script before installing it.

Feel free to fork, edit, and otherwise use any of this code for your own projects.
